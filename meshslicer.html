				<h2>Description</h2>

				<p>In the third year of my Bachelor at the <a href="https://studiegids.hva.nl/hbo-ict-gd-vt/2022-2023">AUAS</a> I interned at the 
					<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/klm-xr-center-of-excellence/">KLM XR Center of Excellence</a>. 
					During this internship I made the functionality for, how I can best describe it, VR fruit ninja. To achieve this, I created an algorithm which
					can split a single mesh into two meshes using a single plane or multiple connected planes.
				</p>

				<h2>What did I learn?</h2>

				<li>Learned how Unity stores data on meshes.</li>
				<li>Learned how to make meshes using an algorithm.</li>
				<li>Learned how to use 3D debugging tools.</li>
				<li>Improved my debugging skills.</li>
				<li>Improved my 3D math skills.</li>
				<p></p>

				<!-- <p>During my internship at the KLM I was tasked with making a VR mesh slicer. The objective was to be able to slice objects with a sword. 
					To make this work, I had to do a lot of research into mesh creation, editing and how Unity stores its meshs' data. 
					Luckily I was already somewhat familiair with this subject, due to having experience with 3D modelling, so I quickly got started. 
				</p>

				<p>I started out trying to map out every edge and vertex in the mesh using visible rays and dots. 
					I also needed something I would slice the mesh with, so the solution I came up with was to track the movement of the sword, and make a mesh/plane out of it's trajectory.
					Now that I had a visual representation of where the mesh would need to be cut and I could take a look at which edges and triangles would be intersected. 
					I wrote an algorithm to detect which edges would be intersected and gave them a different color. You can find an example of this in the videos below. 
					Now that I knew where the cut would be, all that was left to do was create new vertices, edges and triangles at the intersections, separate them into two meshes and voila.
				</p>

				<p>Now ofcourse it all went with a little more difficulty, but in hindsight, it's a very interesting but easy to understand principle.
