							<p>My first Game Development project in Unity3D was: Elemental Dude. To get us inspired we were given the scentence: "Start from nothing". Our game had to represent this scentence. So we took some inspiration from Risk of Rain 2 and made Elemental Dude.</p>
							<p>In this game the player slings around the level while keeping the little alien's glass ball from breaking. When the glass ball hits an object it breaks and you have to start over from the last checkpoint. This game is played using only you mouse. Using left- and right mousebutton you can make the hand grab and release and by moving the mouse the alien starts slinging.</p>
							<p>This game was created in Visual Studio combined with the MonoGame engine using the C# programming language. It was made in collaboration with six classmates and took about half a year (one semester) to finish.</p>
							<p>My contribution to the project was mostly back-end programming. I worked on the physics engine for swinging the alien, worked on the logic for grabbing and releasing and worked on the inverse kinematics for the arms.</p>
