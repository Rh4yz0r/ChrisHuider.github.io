				<h2>Description</h2>

				<p>In the third year of my Bachelor at the <a href="https://studiegids.hva.nl/hbo-ict-gd-vt/2022-2023">AUAS</a> I worked on Astral Drift.<br>
					Astral Drift is a mobile space themed "Shoot 'em up" with player ship customization, a multitude of different enemies and 5 hand made levels.
					This project taught me many things, both about programming and about working in a (for me up untill that point) large team.
				</p>

				<h2>What did I learn?</h2>

				<li>Learned how to use Unity's PlayerPrefs.</li>
				<li>Learned how to create and use a basic GameObject pooling system.</li>
				<li>Learned how to create and use a basic audio management system.</li>
				<li>Learned how to design, create and implement user interfaces.</li>
				<li>Learned how to do basic audio design.</li>
				<li>Improve my knowledge on creating developer tools.</li>
				<p></p>

				<!-- <h2>Description</h2>

				<p>
					Astral Drift is a mobile space themed "Shoot 'em up" with player ship customization, a multitude of different enemies and 5 hand made levels. 
					The player can customize their spaceship with multiple different weapons with different characteristics. 
					These weapons can be unlocked after defeating enemies and picking up their scrap. 
					It's up to the player how to customize their ship in order to face different challenges.
				</p>


				<h2>Backstory</h2>

				<p>
					This game was made during my thematic semester in Gameplay Engineering in my third year of the Bachelor in Game Development. 
					It was made on the instructions of our client Alexander Bonnee and in collaboration with the Amsterdam Mediacollege.
				</p>
				<p>
					We started out with a very basic prototype made by a previous team, but our client wanted it to be totally reworked.
					So we basically started anew, scrapping a lot of old parts of the game, reusing what was usefull.
					At this time we also started working together with five students from the Amsterdam Mediacollege, who would be responsible for creating the game's graphics.
				</p>
				<p>
					In total the project took around three months, after which we delivered the project to our client along with documents detailing everything we'd done.
					In the future, a different team will continue this project in order to add more content to the game. 
					The game will be released on Google Play at a later date.
				</p>


				<h2>My contribution</h2>

				<p>
					During this project I worked on different parts of the game. I started out working on the back-end systems such as user preference and data saving, 
					customizing the player's spaceship, player and enemy weapon creation, GameObject pooling and the Audio manager. 
					These systems were made to be reusable and easy to use for the other developers. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Later on I also worked on designing and implementing the user interface for the garage where the player customizes their spaceship. 
					You can find a picture of the Figma prototype below at "More media". 
					The Figma prototype was made in order to ensure the UI was intuitive and easy to use.
