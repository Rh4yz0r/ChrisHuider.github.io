				<h2>Description</h2>

				<p>In the third year of my Bachelor at the <a href="https://studiegids.hva.nl/hbo-ict-gd-vt/2022-2023">AUAS</a> I interned at the 
					<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/klm-xr-center-of-excellence/">KLM XR Center of Excellence</a>. 
					During this internship I had to rework a node system made for creating graphs containing cockpit procedure sequencing called 'Macadamia'.
				</p>

				<h2>What did I learn?</h2>

				<li>Learned how to create custom editor windows.</li>
				<li>Learned how to use Unity's UIElements system.</li>
				<li>Learned about scriptable object back-end.</li>
				<li>Learned about the positives and negatives of using scriptable objects.</li>
				<li>Learned how to use Unity's experimental GraphView.</li>
				<li>Learned how to design user interfaces for developer tools.</li>
				<li>Learned the basics of user experience in relation to developer tools.</li>
				<p></p>

				<!-- <h2>Description</h2>

				<p>
					Macadamia is a graph system in charge of storing data on flight procedures for the Royal Dutch Airlines' (KLM) cockpit procedure training. 
					It was made using Unity's GraphView with data storage being done using ScriptableObjects. 
					Madacamia is used to store the individual steps for every procedure present in the cockpit procedure training. 
					The user can be guided through each procedure or go through them on their own and depending on which Macadamia will initiate different triggers like 
					showing the next step in the user interface (UI), showing which button or knob to activate next, etc.
				</p>


				<h2>Backstory</h2>

				<p>
					I worked on Macadamia during my internship at the KLM. 
					An ex-colleague made the first version of Macadamia, but after he left, the team was left without any knowledge of it's inner workings. 
					Some adjustments had to be made to Macadamia, but because no-one knew how it worked I took on the task of finding out. 
					Because the back-end of Macadamia was in dire need of some cleaning and an upgrade, I volunteered to rework the entire back-end. 
					After approximately five weeks, the rework was finished and included not only the back-end, 
					but also the UI, data saving and formatting, reusability and making the system easily adjustable. 
				</p>


				<h2>My contribution</h2>

				<p>
					I rebuilt the entire back-end of Macadamia, as well as redesigning the UI with supervision of the design team, 
					changing the way data is saved and formatted and ultimately passing everything I've learned and worked on onto the team so they won't face the same problems again.
					I wrote a document on every element of Macadamia, showing how it works, how to adjust, add or delete elements and explaining simple actions for using Macadamia.
				</p>
				<p>Sadly I cannot go into any technical details, as it's under a Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA).</p> -->
