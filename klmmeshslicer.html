				<p>During my internship at the KLM I was tasked with making a VR mesh slicer. The objective was to be able to slice objects with a sword. 
					To make this work, I had to do a lot of research into mesh creation, editing and how Unity stores its meshs' data. 
					Luckily I was already somewhat familiair with this subject, due to having experience with 3D modelling, so I quickly got started. 
				</p>
				<p>I started out trying to map out every edge and vertex in the mesh using visible rays and dots. 
					I also needed something I would slice the mesh with, so the solution I came up with was to track the movement of the sword, and make a mesh/plane out of it's trajectory.
					Now that I had a visual representation of where the mesh would need to be cut and I could take a look at which edges and triangles would be intersected. 
					I wrote an algorithm to detect which edges would be intersected and gave them a different color. You can find an example of this in the videos below. 
					Now that I knew where the cut would be, all that was left to do was create new vertices, edges and triangles at the intersections, separate them into two meshes and voila.
				</p>
				<p>Now ofcourse it all went with a little more difficulty, but in hindsight, it's a very interesting but easy to understand principle.
