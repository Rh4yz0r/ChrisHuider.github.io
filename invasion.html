				<h2>Description</h2>

				<p>
					Invasion is a "Platform-Shooter" where the player has to use their weapons to traverse the level and defeat enemies. 
					The player can unlock four different weapons which allow the player different types of mobility. 
					These weapons can be unlocked by playing the game and finding them throughout the two levels. 
					At the end of each level, the player will have to face the challenge of defeating an enemy boss in order to advance to the next level. 
				</p>


				<h2>Backstory</h2>

				<p>
					This game was made during my first semester in my first year of my Bachelor in Game Development. 
					For this game our client was Corendon and they wanted a game which could be played on an airplane. 
					We were free to choose the topic of our game, the only restriction was to be able to play it with a Nintendo SNES controller. 
					This meant we were restricted to four movement keys and four action keys. 
					
					After nearly three years, I am currently working on a rework of the game in Unity together with three others.
				</p>


				<h2>My contribution</h2>

				<p>
					My contribution consisted of many different subjects. I started out writing an algorithm to determine collisions. 
					After this I focussed on Enemy statemachines and AI and parallax scrolling of the game's fore- and background. 
					My last task for the project was to make a multitude of particle systems for, for example, the bullet casings and footsteps. 
					During this entire project I also worked as pixel artist, focussing on the backgrounds 
					and designing the levels to work well with the main mechanic of using the player's weapons for level traversal.
